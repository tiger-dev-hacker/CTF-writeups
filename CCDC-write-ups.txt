Good:
+kept almost all services online till around last hour
--ssh was down due to forgetting to update passwords on scorebot
+team utilized resources prepared during competitions
--books and commands to use (print outs, written down etc)
+had a prepared password list to rotate
--saved time swapping out passwords when red teamers got into system
+had food during the competition (thanks O'Leary!)
+team helped each other solve issues cross-jumpbox

Notable:
+4:10pm (à¶ž) [please laugh]
--Red-teamer warned a teammate their system would go down at 4:10pm
+forgot to update jumpbox passwords on scorebot website after changing
--lost points
+critical systems going down brought down other systems
--time spent getting systems back online
+jump box bugs left a couple systems broken
--some teammates couldn't get into their boxes but did help others
+red-team messed up our website in final hour
--couldn't figure out how they did it
+capitol qualified, we did not

Look out for:
+prioritize defending core systems to avoid network going down
+deleting additional users is less important than keeping up services
+act based on what prevents score loss
+backdoors or beacons red-team will use to get into systems easily
--make their jobs hard in down-time
---red team they don't know how they are found
---red team doesn't know how we respond after we kick them out
+red-team messing up our website
+abusible ports than can be blocked
+common OS services red-team can use



Summery:
+prioritize keeping up core systems
+help other teammates when unsure how to defend your system
+don't blue-team on an empty stomach (important!)
+use prepared written and printed resources during competition
+practice website defense (red hat 8)
+know what ports red-team can connect through easily
+know common OS services red-team can use
+make red-team's life difficult
+beat capitol
